bpel-g-tutorial
===============

This is a simple example for a process deployable on the [bpel-g engine](http://code.google.com/p/bpel-g/).
If you package the files in this repository as a zip archive, you can directly deploy it on bpel-g. Just place it in the <code>bpr</code> directory of your Tomcat installation. 

For more details, see [this blog post](http://joerglenhard.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/basic-tutorial-for-the-bpel-g-engine/) from which the code is taken.
